        <p>The office room was in disarray. I had neglected it, opting instead to study for Bayesian Inference. Books and papers were strewn about, and the desk drawers were brimming with stationary, coins, cables, and trinkets.
          Stacks of boxes occupied the corners of the room, while the shelves extended the mess vertically; They were haphazardly filled with binders and books, and crowned with model airplanes, picture frames, and dust.
        The filing cabinets seemed to contain everything but actual files: electronics and wires, measuring tapes, a rubber frog, boxes of broken crayons, and ... was that my missing <span class="item"></span>?</p>
        <p>I better do some spring cleaning in here, I thought. But, I have a dentist appointment soon, so maybe I'll just do it later. I set the <span class="item"></span> on the desk and went to get ready for the appointment.</p>
        <p>I returned home with clean mouth and set my intentions on making the office room even cleaner. I opened the office room door and saw that the room was ... already clean? I guess my mother had cleaned the room while I was gone. 
          I went to the desk to retrieve the <span class="item"></span> I had found earlier, and ... it wasn't there. She must have spring cleaned it away!</p>
        <p>Now, my mother had gone out for groceries so I couldn't ask her where she put the <span class="item"></span>.
        However, I did know enough about her organization methods to estimate some probabilities about where the <span class="item"></span> might be (see the table below).
        Additionally, I really didn't want to spend so much time searching, so I decided to check a new part of the room every 5 minutes.
        I asked myself: <strong>In what order do I search the room to minimize the amount of time I spend searching?</strong></p>

          <p>This isn't necessarily the same as searching the square with the highest probability of having the <span class="item"></span></p>
          <p>For example, the filing cabinet might have a pretty high chance of containing the lost item,
            but it's a lot harder to search the filing cabinet than the waste paper basket, therefore it's less likely overall that I would find the lost item in there.

        <p>Fortunately, I've taken a Bayesian Inference course, which means I can figure out the best order using the Bayesian Search Algorithm!</p>
        <div class="card content">
          <h4>Bayesian Search Algorithm</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>I keep track of the best square to search (the one with the highest expected utility of finding the <span class="item"></span>)</li>
            <li>Assuming I don't find the item, I update my priors and expected utilities of every square.</li>
            <li>Then, I go back to step 1 (unless I want to stop searching)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="m-1">
          <h6>Outlined below is how the search would operate on a particular square, \( k \):</h6>
          <p>Hypothesis: \( H_k: \) the <span class="item"></span> is in square k</p>
          <p>Priors: \( P(H_k)\) is given in the table to the left</p>
          <p>Data: A 5 min search fails to find the <span class="item"></span> in square k</p>
          <p>Likelihoods:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>\( P(D | H_k) = 1 - U(search k | H_k) \) = 1 - (Ease of Detection for square k)</li>
            <li>\( P(D | H_i) = 1 \) for all \( i \neq k \)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Posteriors:</p>
          <p>\( P(H_k | D) = \frac{P(D | H_k) P(H_k)}{P(D | H_K) P(H_K) + \sum P(H_i)} \) for all \( i \neq k \)</p>
          <p>\( P(H_i | D) = \frac{P(H_i)}{P(D | H_k) P(H_k) + \sum P(H_i)}\) all \( i \neq k \)</p>
          <p>Once I have the posteriors I can calculate the expected utility of the search:</p>
          <p>
            Let n be the number of 5 min search periods
            \( EU(search k)_{n=1} = U(search k | H_k) P(H_k) \)
          </p>
          <p>
            And for future 5 min searches (n > 1, and dn-1 is the data from the previous search):
            \( EU(search k | d_{n-1})_{n} = U(search k | H_k) P(H_k | d_{n-1} ) \)
          </p>

     <p class="text-center">In other words, to calculate the expected utilities I just mutiply the ease of detection by the most updated priors.</p>
