        <p>The office room was in disarray. I had neglected it, opting instead to study for Bayesian Inference. Books and papers were strewn about, and the desk drawers were brimming with stationary, coins, and trinkets.
          Stacks of boxes occupied the corners of the room. The shelves extended the mess to new heights; They were haphazardly filled with binders and books, and crowned with model airplanes, picture frames, and dust.
        The filing cabinets seemed to contain everything but actual files: electronics and wires, measuring tapes, a rubber frog, boxes of broken crayons, and ... was that my missing <span class="item"></span>?</p>
        <p>I better do some spring cleaning in here, I thought. But I have a dentist appointment soon, so maybe I'll just do it later. I set the <span class="item"></span> on the desk and went to get ready for the appointment.</p>
        <p>I returned home, intent on making the office room even cleaner than my teeth. I opened the office room door and saw that the room was ... already clean? I guess my mother had tidied up the room while I was gone. 
          I went to the desk to retrieve the <span class="item"></span> I had found earlier, and ... it wasn't there. What are the odds I found my missing <span class="item"></span>, only to lose it again the same day? I was determined to recover it.
          
        </p>
        <p>I checked my phone. I had an unread text from my mother, saying: "Didn't take anything out of the office room, just tidied it up while you were away. Went out for groceries." 
          My mother doesn't touch her phone while out in public given the pandemic, which meant I wouldn't get a reply if I texted her about where she put the <span class="item"></span>.
        However, I did know enough about her organization methods to estimate some probabilities about where the <span class="item"></span> might be.
        Additionally, I didn't want to spend too much time searching because exams were coming up and I needed to study. So, I decided to check a new part of the room every 5 minutes.
        I asked myself: <strong>What order should I search the room to minimize the amount of time I spend searching?</strong></p>

            <p>For every iteration of the algorithm, I keep track of the square that has the highest expected utility.</p>
            <p>This isn't necessarily the same as searching the square with the highest probability of having the <span class="item"></span></p>
            <p>For example, the filing cabinet might have a pretty high chance of containing the lost item,
              but it's a lot harder to search the filing cabinet than the waste paper basket, therefore it's less likely overall that I would find the lost item in the filing cabinet.

        <p>Fortunately, I took a Bayesian Inference course, which meant I could figure out the best order using the Bayesian Search Algorithm!</p>
        <div class="card content border-primary">
          <h4 class="card-title">Bayesian Search Algorithm</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>I keep track of the best square to search (the one with the highest expected utility of finding the <span class="item"></span>)</li>
            <li>Assuming I don't find the <span class="item"></span>, I update my priors and expected utilities of searching every square.</li>
            <li>Then, I go back to step 1 (unless I want to stop searching)</li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <div class="content m-1">
          <h5>Outlined below is how the search works in general:</h5>
          <p><strong>Hypothesis:</strong> \( H_i: \) the <span class="item"></span> is in square \( i \)</p>
          <p><strong>Priors:</strong> \( P(H_i)\) is given in the table to the left, for all \( i \)</p>
          <p><strong>Data:</strong> A 5-minute search fails to find the <span class="item"></span> in square m</p>
          <p><strong>Likelihoods:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>\( P(D | H_m) = 1 - U(search m | H_m) \) = 1 - (Ease of Detection for square m)</li>
            <li>\( P(D | H_i) = 1 \) for all \( i \neq m \)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Posteriors:</strong></p>
          <p>\( P(H_m | D) = \frac{P(D | H_m) P(H_m)}{P(D | H_m) P(H_m) + \sum P(H_i)} \) for all \( i \neq m \)</p>
          <p>\( P(H_i | D) = \frac{P(H_i)}{P(D | H_m) P(H_m) + \sum P(H_i)}\) all \( i \neq m \)</p>
          
          <p><strong>Expected Utilities:</strong></p>
          <p>Once I have the posteriors I can calculate the Expected Utility (EU) of searching each square. The utility of searching a square i that hypothetically doesn't have the item is 0. 
            Therefore, the EU of searching some square k, which I assume does have the item, only depends on the posterior and utility of searching square k</p>
          <p>
            Let n be the number of 5 min searches:
            \( EU(search k)_{n=1} = U(search k | H_k) P(H_k) \)
          </p>
          <p>
            EU for future 5 min searches (n > 1, and dn-1 is the data from the previous search):
            \( EU(search k | d_{n-1})_{n} = U(search k | H_k) P(H_k | d_{n-1} ) \)
          </p>
          <p>Therefore, the next place I search is the location with the highest Expected Utility</p>
